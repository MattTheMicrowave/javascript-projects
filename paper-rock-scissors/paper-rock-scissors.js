/* Write a function named paperRockScossors that accepts a single argument (called whatever you want). This argument should only accept 'paper', 'rock', or 'scissors' as arguments. Any other argument should cease the function and tell us what our options are. The function should randomly select one of the options as well and compare the two. The function should tell us what we and the function each selected and who won.

The result should be something like 'I selected rock and you selected paper. Looks like you won.'

Hint: You may need to look up Math.random() for this function.

* This is a paper, rock, scissors game that generates a random call of the strings 'paper', 'rock', or 'scissors' via the Math.random function, the function is called with a single argument entered by the user as a string of either 'paper', 'rock', or 'scissors'. If one of the three accepted strings is entered the function will log to the console 1 of 9 outcomes of the game, if an incorrect string or other unaccepted data type is entered, the function prompts the user to try again.
